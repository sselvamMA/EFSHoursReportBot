# EFSHoursReportBot

This is a preliminary bot created to do simple formatting of data to a part of an EFS Hours Report. The code can be parallelized to increase runtime
speed as well as keep the code shorter. 

Important notes about the code:
- this code has not been fully web deployed so it runs on a localhost, meaning the computer this code is ran on is both the client and the server
  - this also means that the code must be ran on an IDE
- there are a few cases where you may need to insert values into the code

- please see the code where on lines 92 and 108, you need to insert the filepath into the code

- when the code is run in the IDE, please go to terminal and type **streamlit run {insert filepath of Python file}**
